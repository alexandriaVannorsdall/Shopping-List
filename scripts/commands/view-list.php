/**
 * Lines 5-6 import files with logic that can be used in this file.
 *
 * Line 5 imports the container that has the object and has the means to retrieve it.
 *
 * Line 6 imports the ShoppingListNotFoundException class.
 *
 * Lines 8-11 is an if statement that says if 1 is greater than the number of arguments an error message will be
 * shown on the terminal.
 *
 * Line 13 assigns the variable slug to the first argument given in the terminal.
 *
 * Line 14 assigns the query variable to the static Container class that calls on the getInstance function that calls
 * on the getShoppingListDetailQuery function.
 *
 * Lines 16-21 is a try and catch block. The list variable is calling on the query variable that calls on the
 * execute function that is passing in the slug variable.
 * In the catch section the ShoppingListNotFoundException class is called with the variable ex to validate the given information.
 * It then echoes a statement that tells the user that their list doesn't exist with the slug variable and then exits
 * the loop.
 *
 * Lines 23-29 is an if statement that passes in the variables list that calls on the isEmpty function. It then echoes
 * a statement to the terminal using the sprintf function saying that the list has no items. Then it calls on the list
 * variable which calls on the getName function and then exits the loop.
 *
 * Line 31 uses the sprintf function to echo to the terminal the items that were inputted in the terminal if the
 * script was successful. The list variable then calls on the getName function, then the list variable calls on the count
 * function.
 *
 * Lines 33-40 is a foreach loop that passes in the list variable that calls on the getItems function as item. It then
 * echoes to the terminal using the sprintf function the id, complete (being ticked off or not), and the name of the item.
